 1what makes numPY.shape()different from NumPy.size()?
 ans,inoticed that some numpy operations take an argument called shape, such as np.zeros,where as some others
 take an argument called size such as np.random.randint.to me, those arguments have the same function and the fact
 that they have different names is a bit confusing.


 2.In numPy describe the idea of broadcasting?
 ans, the term broadcasting refers to the ability of numpy to treat arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations.
      arithmetic operations on arrays are usually done on corresponding elements.if two arrays are of extremely the same shape 
     then these operators are smoothly performed.


 3.what makes python better than other libraries for numerical computation?
 ans,1.scientific numeric library
   lib:this function is used to wrap python external library.
   linals: used for regular linear algebra applications.
   consonants:this algebra includes physical separation and conversion components.

    2.pandas(data analysis library)
    panda is most important data analysis library of python bing open source is used for analysing data with python.
    it can take data formats of csv or tsv files or a sql data base and convert into python data frames with rows
    and columns which is similar to tables in statistical formats.the package makes comparision with  dictionaries
    with the aid of 'for' loops which are very easy to understand and operte.
 


   4.how does numPy deals with files?
   ans.**the numpysave()file store the input array in disk file with npy extension.
   ***import numpy as np
   a=np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
   np.save('outfile',a)***

  ***to reconstrut array from outfilenpy use load() function
  **import numpy as np
  b=np.load('outfile.npy')
  print b****

 *** the storage and retrived of array data in a simple text file format is done with save txt() and load txt() functions
 ***import numpy as np
 a=np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
 np.savetxt('out.txt',a)
 b=np.array('out.txt')
 print b*****


 5.mention the importane of numPy.empty()?
 ans,*This funtion is used to create an array with out intializing  the enteries of given shape and type.
     *it provides support for large multidemensional array  objects and varies tools to work with them.
